I would want to use a remote repository rather than keep all my work local when:
I am collaborating with other people and they need access to my work and/or are editing the same piece of work
I am traveling and will be working off a different computer
I want my work to be safe in case my computer fails

I might want to always pull changes manually rather than have Git automatically stay up-to-date with my remote repository because:
If my repository is public, somebody else may make changes that I don't want in my local/remote repository

The differences between forks, clones, and branches:
Forks--I copy an existing repository that's on GitHub so I can make changes it to it in my own account.
My changes don't affect the original, and there's a record on the original repository of how many people
have forked that repository, and my version cites the original that I forked from. This is within GitHub.
Clones--When I make a copy of a repository for use on my own local machine, like for asteroids.
Branches--versions within my own repository.
I'd use forks when I want to work off someone else's work;
clones when nobody else needs to access the copy?
branches when I am doing versions within my own work.
