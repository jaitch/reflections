When I initialize a repository, the computer creates a group of files. I need to do it because then it's easy to create commits of this repository as a whole.

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it allows you to add things one at a time,
and it's like a holding pen for you to move things to before you commit them together as a repository.
Tha value it offers is being able to change your mind and to make a repository out of files from different places.

I can use the staging area to make sure I have one commit per logical change by:
always putting things in the staging area after I make any change (when I have to stop) then figuring
out of there has been a logical change? Not sure about this one.

Situations in which branches would be helpful in keeping my history organized:
if mutliple people are editing something at the same time, as long as merge is easy enough
if i have different ideas and want to try them out
if there are different aspects i want to work on but am worried about screwing the working version up

Branches would help by:
diverging versions

Diagrams help me visualize the branch structure by:
making a graphic representation with flow and ends and connections.

The result of merging two branches together is:
one set of code with the changes combined.
We represent it in the diagram the way we do because:
it brings them together and also makes the new master limb. arrows go to both.
