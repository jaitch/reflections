When I initialize a repository, the computer creates a group of files. I need to do it because then it's easy to create commits of this repository as a whole.

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository because it allows you to add things one at a time,
and it's like a holding pen for you to move things to before you commit them together as a repository.
Tha value it offers is being able to change your mind and to make a repository out of files from different places.
